// PartialEq, Eq and Hash on Type are written by hand (below the enum) rather than
// derived, for one reason: NumberLiteral(f64). f64 has no total Eq or Hash (NaN is
// not equal to itself), but TypeArena::alloc uses a Type as a hash-map key to
// reuse the TypeId of an identical composite. NumberLiteral is therefore compared
// and hashed by f64::to_bits(), so `==` and `hash` always agree with each other.
//
// Both are SHALLOW: a composite's TypeId fields are compared and hashed as opaque
// ids, never followed through the arena. That is what makes the intern table safe
// for self-referential types (two still-unresolved declarations have different Ref
// ids, so they never look alike) and it is only sound because every child id was itself
// obtained from the arena. A consequence: `==` on a Type still cannot answer "are
// these the same type by shape" for composites whose children are different ids.
// Use TypeArena::structurally_equal for that; it follows TypeIds through the arena.
