// Diagnostic counts measured with examples/dhat_heap.rs on the interning commit.
// The checker reports several diagnostics on these fixtures (wide union: 2 per
// variant; `first<T>` returning `items[0]`: 1; connected app: about 10 per unit),
// so the counts pin behavior. If one changes after an arena edit, look at the
// messages before looking at the timings.
//
// The connected_application counts were lowered by exactly one per unit (10 -> 9)
// when parenthesized expressions started being looked through (350d5b5). Each
// unit's `runBatch` ends in `return ( ... );`, which used to hit the catch-all in
// infer_expression_type and report one "unimplemented expression kind" warning.
// That warning is gone on purpose.
//
// They dropped again, to 2 per unit plus 1 from the shared prelude (21, 101 and 201
// at scales 10, 50 and 100), and complex_mixed_scale_200 from 205 to 5, when a
// property read on a union became legal whenever every member has the property.
// Before that, reading a shared field such as `kind` on an un-narrowed union was
// reported as missing, once per read. The wide_union_50 count went to 0 for the
// same reason. Print the remaining messages before trusting a new number.
